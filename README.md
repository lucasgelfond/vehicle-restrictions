As the tiny house movement begins to takeoff, many building these portable homes attempt to max out the size of their house while still conforming to state or country standards. As I haven't seen it elsewhere, I made a spreadsheet with all of the max  heights for the US states (maybe Canada/Mexico coming soon) that come with sources and listings of the conflicts.

To note, one thing mentioned a lot is <a href="http://www.washto.org/"> WASHTO</a> which is an organization of multiple states that agree upon vehicle restrictions. That saved a lot of time, but I've found conflicts with things here (official WASHTO rules specify 14' max, whereas Alaska specifically say 15' max).

I've put this on GitHub so that others can issue pull requests if they find conflicts with some of this or find that I quoted wrong or got something else wrong. 

This is licensed under GPL V3. I doubt you'd ever use it commerically without sharing alike, but I'd consider making exceptions to the rules if one was interested.

Enjoy.
